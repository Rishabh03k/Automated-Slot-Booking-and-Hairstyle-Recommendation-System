npm install  
Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key  
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key  
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=your-dynamodb-table-name  
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name  
API_GATEWAY_URL=your-api-gateway-url  
# 🛠️ AWS Resources Configuration
Step 1: Deploy CloudFormation Template
Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
Create a new stack using the provided cloudformation-template.yaml.
Wait for the stack creation to complete.
Step 2: Upload Machine Learning Model
Navigate to Amazon S3.
Create a bucket or use the bucket created by the CloudFormation stack.
Upload your trained model file (model.tar.gz).
Step 3: Deploy Lambda Functions
From the backend folder, run:
npm run deploy  
🚀 Running the Project
Step 1: Start the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder:
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm start  
Step 2: Test the APIs
Use Postman or cURL to test endpoints (e.g., booking slots, fetching recommendations).
Example cURL request:
curl -X POST https://your-api-gateway-url/slots -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "123", "slot": "2025-01-15T10:00:00"}'  
Step 3: Use the Application
Open the frontend app in your browser.
Register a user and upload an image for hairstyle recommendations.
Book an available slot and view confirmation.
